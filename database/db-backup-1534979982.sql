As a small business owner myself, I thought you would really benefit from something that worked tremendously well for me, attracting a ton of traffic and new customers. Itâ€™s this new thing called a â€œvideo testimonial.â€ In plain English, itâ€™s basically a mini commercial for your biz, but you can write your own script, choose your own actor, and itâ€™s pretty darn cheap for what youâ€™re getting.  I tried it out for my own biz and it turned out great. Itâ€™s like a review for your business but it looks like an actual customer did it, blogging about your product because theyâ€™re so satisfied with it. Itâ€™s the best business expenses and the best investment Iâ€™ve ever made, and you can try it out at http://www.buy-testimonials.org.

My name is Devin Sorbert - I\\\'m a media manager at Social Media Gurus. We\\\'re a 3 person full social media management company based out of Greater Grand Rapids, Michigan. We handle account creation and growth for small businesses - and our 3rd partner has spent 3 years setting up Facebook and Google Adwords campaigns for small businesses for local lead generation for a Grand Rapids media management company before coming to work with us. 
 
I saw sls-egypt.com and want to know if you\\\'re interested in expanding your social media presence? Basically - more fans, likes and general engagement on your Facebook page? 
 
It\\\'s really easy - we\\\'d do a free 15 minute consultation over phone or Skype - where we\\\'ll fill out a simple questionnaire to figure out the specific social media needs for your business. I\\\'ll show you some references and current clients pages that have consented to being used as examples (pet shelters and such) - and explain why more fans and activity on your page will help your business. If during the consultation we learn that you sell commercially/are happy with 10 fans on your page/have no business use for social media presence - I won\\\'t sell you garbage. Chemical factories don\\\'t need Facebook pages (unless they\\\'d like a corporate page) - and I won\\\'t argue with that. 
 
Our prices start at $189 a month for complete management and assistance of your media profile. Our prices reflect the service quality - if you\\\'ve had bad experiences buying fans for $20 on Fiverr that were deleted/had your account suspended - we can rectify that. We run small media campaigns throughout the month creating natural fan growth to your page - no automated accounts or likes, and no chance of any account issues. We also do not need any security information to promote your page - anyone who does probably uses a form of automation to grow your account. 
 
Check out these monthly plans to get a full idea of everything we do for your page and then send me a reply for your consultation :) 
http://socialmediagurus.net/ 
 
If I can help you - reply back at emailsocialmediagurus@mail.com and we\\\'ll set up a good time for you to create a plan for sls-egypt.com.

All online businesses need targeted website visitors in order to be successful. Fox Media Marketing operates an online advertising network built to help webmasters and businesses get high quality targeted website traffic at reasonable prices. Instead of spending $1,000s to place one SINGLE ad on one media source and gamble that it\\\'ll be a hit - Fox Media Marketing is composed of thousands of websites worldwide; this network receives hundreds of thousands of site visitors daily. Your website is shown to the visitors of our advertising network, based on the selected geographic or language needs of your needs. 
 
Here\\\'s how it works: http://foxmediamarketing.com/how-it-works/ 
 
Once your campaign is active, weâ€™ll display your website on our network where it will be seen by visitors like you browsing music videos, getting their local weather, playing games, getting sports headlines, news, pictures, reviews and more. 
 
- Choose from 120+ different niches for any of your websites 
- Choose to target SPECIFIC portions of America that you want to market to, as well as other major countries. 
- Track the traffic with any popular tracking service like Google Analytics on sls-egypt.com directly - no more having to trust 3rd party tracking sources! If you don\\\'t know how to set up tracking on your website - your dedicated support will help you. 
 
If you want to start getting more visitors, leads, subscriptions, whatever - you need MORE traffic! It\\\'s that simple.

No. A27 Grade 60-30 and B.S. 3100 Grade A1. The heavy-duty bails are suitable for picking up and laying down a drill collar with the catline.<br /><br />The Threads and shoulders of the Cast Steel Thread Protectors with lifting bails / Lift Nubbins are precision machined to the requirements set by the A.P.I.

<p class=\"style58\"><span class=\"style58\">Each Cast Steel Thread Protector with lifting bail / Lift Nubbin has b</span>een load tested and inspected prior to sale. Due to the rough nature in which drill collars are handled, Revata Engineering recommends that the end users carry out frequent inspection to ensure that the bail is not cracked, threads are not damaged and that proper fitting to the connection is possible.</p>
<p class=\"style58\"><br /><strong><em>Note: Cast Steel Thread Protectors with lifting bail / Lift Nubbins should only be used to pick up or lay down one drill collar at the same time.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><span class=\"style58\"><br />The standard Threads and Sizes available are as follows. However, we can also manufacture as per your specific requirements.</span></strong></p>
